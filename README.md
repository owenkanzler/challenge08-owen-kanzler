## Description

This is challenge 8 of the UMN Bootcamp. Here I used object oriented programming to create a logo generator. I did so by creating a shape class and multiple different shapes that inherit from the shape class. I then created the index.js where I propmted the user to enter the information they wanted for their logo using the inquirer package. I then used the information to create the logo as an svg file using the built in fs package. I tested the program using jest.
